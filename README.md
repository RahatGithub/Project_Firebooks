_________ABOUT THIS PROJECT_________

Name : Firebooks

Description : This is a simple(so far!) web application that will help you to find some popular books and you can download them for free. 

Commitment : Currently, I am working on this project for having a better grip on Django. I am always thinking of making it better and better. Soon I will add some more advanced 
             features to it. Hope you will like them!
